Bug #1: Segfault
    -struct int_list odd changed to struct int_list odd = {.next = NULL, .value =0};
    -After while loop goes through once, there's a segfault

Bug #2: assertion
	-list = list->next;
	-need to incrememnt previous or they will be separated 
	-added previous = list;

Bug #3: assert(0);
	when if statement fails assert(0) runs and closes the program. returning a non 0 number fixes this

Bug #4:	SIGABRT error
	- assert(prev->next == node) fails 
	- previous is null
	-Solution: incriment the list every time you have a while loop so upon the first call previous won't be null

Bug #5: INFINITE LOOPS R GRRRRRRR8
	-struct int_list list2 = {.value = 5, .next = &list2};
	- list2 goes to list2, instead list2 should go to list3
